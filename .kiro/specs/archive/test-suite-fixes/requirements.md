# Test Suite Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining test failures in the Steampunk Idle Game test suite. After previous optimization efforts, we have 73 failing tests that need systematic fixes to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lambda Function Test Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Lambda function tests to pass, so that I can be confident in the serverless functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Lambda tests THEN all currency transaction tests SHALL pass with proper mock expectations
2. WHEN testing auction Lambda functions THEN all auction creation and expiration tests SHALL return expected status codes
3. WHEN testing crafting Lambda functions THEN all startCrafting tests SHALL handle Lambda context properly
4. WHEN testing activity Lambda functions THEN all calculateOfflineProgress tests SHALL return 200 status codes
5. WHEN testing chat Lambda functions THEN all sendMessage tests SHALL return proper messageId values

### Requirement 2: Type Validation Test Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type validation tests to pass, so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating character objects THEN the CharacterSchema SHALL accept valid character data
2. WHEN testing character validation THEN all required skill fields SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN running validation tests THEN missing harvesting and combat skills SHALL be handled correctly

### Requirement 3: Service Test Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service layer tests to pass, so that business logic is properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing slashCommandService THEN error messages SHALL match expected text patterns
2. WHEN running service tests THEN all mock expectations SHALL align with actual implementation
3. WHEN testing service functions THEN proper error handling SHALL be verified

### Requirement 4: Mock and Setup Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent mock behavior across tests, so that tests are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Lambda context mocks THEN all required properties SHALL be properly defined
2. WHEN mocking AWS SDK clients THEN proper initialization order SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN testing database operations THEN transaction expectations SHALL match implementation
4. WHEN mocking external services THEN consistent patterns SHALL be used across all tests
