# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user interface and user experience of the existing Steampunk Idle Game by making the Game Features menu fully interactive and improving the accessibility of core game systems. The implementation focuses on UI/UX improvements, modal interfaces, and streamlined user interactions rather than backend functionality (which is covered in the steampunk-idle-game spec).
