# Character Creation Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The character creation functionality is currently failing with a "Network error during character creation" message when users attempt to create a character. This is happening because the CharacterService is trying to make API calls to a backend server that doesn't exist in the development environment, instead of using the intended localStorage-based mock functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Development Mode Detection

**User Story:** As a developer running the application locally, I want character creation to work without requiring a backend API server, so that I can test the frontend functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running in development mode THEN the CharacterService SHALL use localStorage-based mock functionality
2. WHEN the environment detection fails THEN the system SHALL default to development mode behavior
3. WHEN NODE_ENV is not properly detected THEN the system SHALL provide fallback detection mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Improve Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when character creation fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN character creation fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN the system is in offline mode THEN the user SHALL be informed that character creation requires an internet connection
3. WHEN character creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable next steps to the user

### Requirement 3: Add Development Mode Indicators

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to know when the application is running in development mode, so that I understand which features are using mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in development mode THEN there SHALL be a visual indicator in the UI
2. WHEN using mock authentication THEN the user SHALL be informed they are using test data
3. WHEN character data is stored locally THEN the user SHALL understand this is temporary test data

### Requirement 4: Ensure Consistent Environment Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all services to consistently detect the development environment, so that the application behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service checks for development mode THEN it SHALL use a consistent detection method
2. WHEN environment variables are unavailable THEN the system SHALL have reliable fallback logic
3. WHEN running via npm start THEN all services SHALL correctly identify development mode
