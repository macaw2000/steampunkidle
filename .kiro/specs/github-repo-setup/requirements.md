# GitHub Repository Setup - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a private GitHub repository and uploading the current codebase with the recent test suite improvements. The goal is to establish version control for the Steampunk Idle Game project and preserve the work done on fixing skipped tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a private GitHub repository, so that I can store my code securely and track changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new repository THEN it SHALL be set to private visibility
2. WHEN I create the repository THEN it SHALL have a descriptive name like "steampunk-idle-game"
3. WHEN I create the repository THEN it SHALL include a README file describing the project
4. IF the repository is created successfully THEN it SHALL be accessible only to authorized users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize Git in my local project, so that I can track changes and prepare for uploading to GitHub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize Git THEN it SHALL create a .git directory in the project root
2. WHEN I add files to Git THEN it SHALL stage all relevant project files
3. WHEN I create the initial commit THEN it SHALL include all project files with a meaningful commit message
4. WHEN I check Git status THEN it SHALL show a clean working directory after the initial commit

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect my local repository to the GitHub remote, so that I can push my code to the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add the remote origin THEN it SHALL point to the correct GitHub repository URL
2. WHEN I push to the remote THEN it SHALL upload all local commits to GitHub
3. WHEN I verify the push THEN the GitHub repository SHALL contain all project files
4. IF there are authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a proper .gitignore file, so that unnecessary files are not tracked in version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create .gitignore THEN it SHALL exclude node_modules directory
2. WHEN I create .gitignore THEN it SHALL exclude build artifacts and dist folders
3. WHEN I create .gitignore THEN it SHALL exclude environment files like .env.local
4. WHEN I create .gitignore THEN it SHALL exclude IDE-specific files and OS-specific files
5. WHEN I add files to Git THEN ignored files SHALL NOT be staged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to document the recent test improvements, so that the repository clearly shows the work accomplished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create the initial commit THEN it SHALL include a commit message describing the test fixes
2. WHEN I update the README THEN it SHALL mention the test suite status and improvements
3. WHEN I review the repository THEN it SHALL clearly show the fixed test files
4. WHEN someone clones the repository THEN they SHALL understand the current test status
