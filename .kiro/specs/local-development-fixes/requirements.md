# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical issues preventing the steampunk idle game from running properly in local development, specifically component loading failures and network connectivity issues that affect the user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Header Component Loading

**User Story:** As a developer running the application locally, I want the header component to load successfully so that I can see the complete application interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the AppHeader component SHALL render without errors
2. WHEN there are component errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages for debugging
3. WHEN the header loads successfully THEN it SHALL display navigation elements and user information
4. IF the header fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the entire application

### Requirement 2: Fix Character Creation Network Connectivity

**User Story:** As a player trying to create a character, I want the character creation process to work without network errors so that I can start playing the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to create a character THEN the system SHALL successfully communicate with the backend services
2. WHEN character creation is initiated THEN the system SHALL handle network requests properly without "Network error during character creation"
3. WHEN character creation succeeds THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the main game interface
4. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL work with mock data or local services if backend is unavailable

### Requirement 3: Improve Local Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to run smoothly in local development mode so that I can develop and test features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm start` THEN the application SHALL start without critical component failures
2. WHEN components fail to load THEN the error boundaries SHALL provide detailed debugging information
3. WHEN network services are unavailable THEN the application SHALL fall back to mock data or offline mode
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the console SHALL provide clear error messages and stack traces
5. WHEN the application loads THEN all essential components SHALL render successfully

### Requirement 4: Restore Original GameDashboard Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access all game features through the main dashboard so that I can play the complete game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component issues are resolved THEN the original GameDashboard SHALL be restored
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN all game features SHALL be accessible (harvesting, crafting, combat, etc.)
3. WHEN switching between features THEN the interface SHALL respond smoothly without errors
4. WHEN the character exists THEN the dashboard SHALL display character information correctly
5. WHEN the dashboard is fully functional THEN the debug version SHALL be removed
