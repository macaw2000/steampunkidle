# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Diagnose and fix AppHeader component failure


  - Identify the specific error causing AppHeader to fail in the error boundary
  - Check for missing imports, undefined dependencies, or runtime errors
  - Create a minimal AppHeader debug version to isolate the issue
  - Fix the root cause of the AppHeader failure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement enhanced error boundary with detailed logging




  - Modify ErrorBoundary component to capture more detailed error information
  - Add console logging with component name, error details, and stack trace
  - Include dependency status checking in error boundary
  - Create fallback UI that shows debug information in development mode
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 3.2_



- [x] 3. Create mock character service for local development



  - Implement MockCharacterService class with same interface as real service
  - Add mock data for character creation and retrieval
  - Include configurable delays and error simulation
  - Create service health checking mechanism




  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Fix character creation network connectivity
  - Identify the specific network error in character creation process
  - Implement network client with retry logic and timeout handling
  - Add automatic fallback to mock service when network fails
  - Create clear error messages for network failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement service health monitoring system
  - Create DevServiceManager to check service availability
  - Add health status indicators for auth, character, and other services
  - Implement automatic switching between live and mock services
  - Add service status display in development mode
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Create component recovery mechanisms
  - Add component remount functionality to error boundaries
  - Implement retry buttons for failed components
  - Create graceful degradation for non-critical component failures
  - Add manual recovery options in error fallback UI
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.2, 3.5_

- [ ] 7. Enhance local development startup process
  - Add service connectivity checks during application startup
  - Implement automatic mock mode activation when services are unavailable
  - Create startup health check dashboard for development
  - Add clear console messages about service status and mock mode
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Test and validate error handling systems
  - Test component failure scenarios with enhanced error boundaries
  - Validate network fallback mechanisms work correctly
  - Test character creation with both live and mock services
  - Verify error recovery mechanisms function properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 9. Restore original GameDashboard functionality


  - Remove debug GameDashboard and restore original component
  - Verify all game features work with improved error handling
  - Test component switching and feature access
  - Ensure character information displays correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 10. Clean up and finalize local development improvements
  - Remove temporary debug components and console logs
  - Add documentation for local development setup
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Verify application runs smoothly with all fixes applied
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 4.5_
