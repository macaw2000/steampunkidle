# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Steampunk Idle Game frontend is experiencing network connectivity issues that prevent proper application functionality. Users encounter service health check failures on the splash screen and network connection lost errors during character creation. These issues occur because the frontend is trying to connect to AWS backend services that are not yet deployed, causing the application to fail gracefully. The solution needs to provide robust offline/fallback functionality while maintaining the ability to connect to AWS services when they become available.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the application to load successfully without service health check failures, so that I can access the game interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the splash screen SHALL display without service health check failures
2. WHEN backend services are unavailable THEN the health check SHALL use fallback logic to determine service status
3. WHEN the user has internet connectivity THEN the health check SHALL report services as available
4. IF backend services are deployed THEN the health check SHALL attempt to connect to actual AWS services
5. WHEN health checks complete THEN the application SHALL proceed to the main interface regardless of backend availability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create characters without network connection errors, so that I can start playing the game immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to create a character THEN the system SHALL NOT display "network connection lost" errors
2. WHEN backend services are unavailable THEN character creation SHALL use local storage as a fallback
3. WHEN a character is created locally THEN it SHALL be stored persistently until backend services are available
4. IF backend services become available THEN locally stored characters SHALL be synchronized to the server
5. WHEN character creation succeeds THEN the user SHALL be able to proceed with gameplay

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the network status indicator to accurately reflect the application's connectivity state, so that I understand when features may be limited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running in offline mode THEN the network indicator SHALL show "Offline Mode" status
2. WHEN backend services are unavailable but internet is available THEN the indicator SHALL show "Limited Connectivity"
3. WHEN all services are available THEN the indicator SHALL show "Connected" status
4. WHEN network status changes THEN the indicator SHALL update in real-time
5. WHEN hovering over the status indicator THEN it SHALL display detailed information about service availability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to gracefully handle missing backend services, so that frontend development can continue independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any AWS service call fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt fallback behavior
2. WHEN operating in fallback mode THEN all core game features SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN backend services become available THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect
4. IF reconnection succeeds THEN locally stored data SHALL be synchronized with the server
5. WHEN in development mode THEN detailed error information SHALL be available in the console

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be preserved even when backend services are unavailable, so that I don't lose my gameplay progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing in offline mode THEN all game progress SHALL be stored locally
2. WHEN backend services become available THEN local progress SHALL be synchronized to the server
3. IF there are conflicts during synchronization THEN the system SHALL preserve the most recent progress
4. WHEN synchronization completes THEN the user SHALL be notified of successful data backup
5. WHEN local storage is full THEN the system SHALL manage storage efficiently and notify the user
