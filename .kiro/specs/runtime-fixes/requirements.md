# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses runtime issues that prevent the Steampunk Idle Game application from starting and running properly in development mode. The application builds successfully but encounters errors when attempting to run `npm start`, preventing developers from testing and developing the application locally.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start successfully with `npm start`, so that I can develop and test the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `npm start` THEN the application SHALL start without runtime errors
2. WHEN the development server starts THEN the application SHALL be accessible in a web browser
3. WHEN the application loads THEN all core components SHALL render without JavaScript errors
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the console SHALL not show any critical runtime errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when runtime issues occur, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages
2. WHEN component rendering fails THEN the error SHALL indicate which component and why
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the error SHALL include relevant debugging information
4. WHEN the application crashes THEN the error boundary SHALL catch and display the error gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle missing dependencies gracefully, so that partial functionality works even when some services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the application SHALL continue to function with reduced features
2. WHEN API endpoints return errors THEN the UI SHALL display appropriate fallback content
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL be redirected to login without crashing
4. WHEN data loading fails THEN loading states SHALL be handled gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hot reloading to work properly during development, so that I can see changes immediately without manual refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are saved THEN the browser SHALL automatically reload the updated components
2. WHEN CSS changes are made THEN styles SHALL update without full page refresh
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed clearly in the browser
4. WHEN the development server restarts THEN it SHALL reconnect automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single unified progress bar for all activities, so that the interface remains clean and uncluttered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any task is running THEN there SHALL be only one progress bar visible in the application
2. WHEN multiple tasks are queued THEN the single progress bar SHALL show the current active task progress
3. WHEN implementing new features THEN no additional progress bars SHALL be created
4. WHEN displaying task progress THEN it SHALL always use the existing unified progress system
