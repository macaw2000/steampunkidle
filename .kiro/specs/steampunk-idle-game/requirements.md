# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Steampunk-themed idle game. The game will be a web-based application featuring automated progression mechanics, social guild systems, and character classes with Steampunk aesthetics. The application will be built using React for the frontend and AWS serverless technologies for the backend, with a complete DevOps pipeline for deployment and maintenance.
