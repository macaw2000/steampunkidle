# Global Task Queue System Requirements

## Introduction

The Global Task Queue System is the core idle game mechanic that allows players to queue harvesting, crafting, and combat tasks that execute whether the player is online or offline. This system ensures continuous progression and provides the foundation for all game activities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Global Player Task Queue

**User Story:** As a player, I want a persistent task queue that continues processing my tasks even when I'm offline, so that I can make progress in the game continuously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player logs in THEN the system SHALL restore their task queue state from the server
2. WHEN a player is offline THEN the server SHALL continue processing their queued tasks
3. WHEN a player returns online THEN the system SHALL sync completed tasks and rewards
4. WHEN a task completes THEN the system SHALL automatically start the next queued task
5. IF no tasks are queued THEN the system SHALL remain idle until new tasks are added

### Requirement 2: Multi-Activity Task Support

**User Story:** As a player, I want to queue different types of activities (harvesting, crafting, combat) in any order, so that I can plan my character progression efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player adds a harvesting task THEN the system SHALL queue it with appropriate duration and rewards
2. WHEN a player adds a crafting task THEN the system SHALL queue it with material requirements and crafting time
3. WHEN a player adds a combat task THEN the system SHALL queue it with enemy selection and combat duration
4. WHEN tasks of different types are queued THEN the system SHALL process them in FIFO order
5. WHEN a task requires resources THEN the system SHALL validate availability before starting

### Requirement 3: Queue Management Operations

**User Story:** As a player, I want to add, remove, and reorder tasks in my queue, so that I can adapt my strategy as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player adds a task THEN the system SHALL append it to their queue
2. WHEN a player cancels a queued task THEN the system SHALL remove it without affecting the current task
3. WHEN a player stops all tasks THEN the system SHALL cancel the current task and clear the queue
4. WHEN a player views their queue THEN the system SHALL display all queued tasks with estimated completion times
5. WHEN a player reorders tasks THEN the system SHALL update the queue order accordingly

### Requirement 4: Task Persistence and Recovery

**User Story:** As a player, I want my task progress to be saved continuously, so that no progress is lost due to disconnections or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task starts THEN the system SHALL save the task state to persistent storage
2. WHEN task progress updates THEN the system SHALL periodically save progress to prevent data loss
3. WHEN a player reconnects THEN the system SHALL restore the exact task state including progress
4. WHEN the server restarts THEN the system SHALL resume all player task queues from saved state
5. IF task data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors without breaking the queue

### Requirement 5: Real-time Progress Updates

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see real-time progress of my current task and queue status, so that I can monitor my character's activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is running THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates at least every second
2. WHEN a task completes THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the UI with rewards
3. WHEN the queue changes THEN the system SHALL update the queue display in real-time
4. WHEN multiple clients are connected THEN the system SHALL sync progress across all sessions
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to cached state

### Requirement 6: Resource and Prerequisite Validation

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to validate that I have the required resources and meet prerequisites before starting tasks, so that tasks don't fail unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a crafting task starts THEN the system SHALL verify all required materials are available
2. WHEN a combat task starts THEN the system SHALL verify the player meets level requirements
3. WHEN resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL pause the queue and notify the player
4. WHEN prerequisites are met again THEN the system SHALL automatically resume the queue
5. WHEN a task fails validation THEN the system SHALL skip it and continue with the next task

### Requirement 7: Reward Distribution and Inventory Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive rewards from completed tasks automatically, so that my character progresses without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task completes THEN the system SHALL calculate rewards based on task type and player stats
2. WHEN rewards are generated THEN the system SHALL add them to the player's inventory
3. WHEN inventory is full THEN the system SHALL handle overflow gracefully
4. WHEN experience is gained THEN the system SHALL update character level if thresholds are met
5. WHEN rare items are found THEN the system SHALL notify the player with special effects

### Requirement 8: Queue Limits and Balancing

**User Story:** As a player, I want reasonable limits on queue size and task duration, so that the game remains balanced and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player queues tasks THEN the system SHALL enforce a maximum queue size of 50 tasks
2. WHEN a single task exceeds 24 hours THEN the system SHALL reject it as too long
3. WHEN the total queue time exceeds 7 days THEN the system SHALL warn the player
4. WHEN a player is inactive for 30 days THEN the system SHALL pause their queue
5. WHEN queue limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the player

### Requirement 9: Cross-Platform Synchronization

**User Story:** As a player, I want my task queue to work consistently across different devices and platforms, so that I can play seamlessly anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player switches devices THEN the system SHALL sync their complete queue state
2. WHEN multiple devices are online THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicting queue modifications
3. WHEN offline changes are made THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using server state as authority
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN permanent sync failure occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve local state until connection is restored

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As the game grows, I want the task queue system to handle thousands of concurrent players efficiently, so that performance remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing 1000+ concurrent task queues THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times
2. WHEN database load is high THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and query optimization
3. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL implement efficient garbage collection
4. WHEN server load spikes THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade non-critical features
5. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL distribute task processing across multiple servers
