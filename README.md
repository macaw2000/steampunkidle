# Steampunk Idle Game

A web-based multiplayer idle game featuring automated progression, social interactions, and Steampunk aesthetics.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Redux for state management
- **Backend**: AWS serverless architecture (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with social provider integration
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- **Local Development**: LocalStack for local AWS services

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- AWS CLI configured (for deployment)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for LocalStack)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Local Development with LocalStack

Start LocalStack services:
```bash
npm run localstack:start
```

Deploy infrastructure to LocalStack:
```bash
# AWS Configuration (Production Only)
# Set your AWS credentials and region
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# Deploy CDK stack to LocalStack
npm run cdk:deploy
```

Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be deployed to AWS CloudFront and available at your configured domain.

### 3. AWS Deployment

Configure your AWS credentials and deploy:
```bash
# Deploy to AWS
npm run cdk:deploy

# The output will provide the CloudFront URL and API endpoints
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start React development server
- `npm run build` - Build production React app
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run cdk:deploy` - Deploy CDK stack
- `npm run cdk:destroy` - Destroy CDK stack
- `npm run cdk:synth` - Synthesize CDK templates
- `npm run build` - Build for AWS deployment
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to AWS infrastructure
