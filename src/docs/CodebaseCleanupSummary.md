# AWS-Only Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup performed to remove all local development infrastructure and mock services from the Steampunk Idle Game codebase, creating a streamlined AWS-only architecture.

## Files Removed

### Local Development Server
- `src/server/gameEngine.local.js` - Local development game engine server

### Mock Services
- `src/services/mockCharacterService.ts` - Mock character service implementation
- `src/services/mockApiService.ts` - Mock API service implementation  
- `src/services/devServiceManager.ts` - Development service manager

### Development-Only Components
- `src/components/dev/ServiceHealthIndicator.css` - Service health indicator styles
- `src/components/dev/ServiceHealthIndicator.tsx` - Service health indicator component
- `src/components/common/AppHeaderDebug.tsx` - Debug header component

### Local Development Specs
- `.kiro/specs/local-development-fixes/requirements.md`
- `.kiro/specs/local-development-fixes/design.md`
- `.kiro/specs/local-development-fixes/tasks.md`

### Test Files
- `src/services/__tests__/mockCharacterService.test.ts` - Mock service tests

## Files Modified

### Package Configuration
- `package.json` - Removed local development scripts (`start:server:local`, `dev`) and `concurrently` dependency

### Service Files
- `src/services/serverTaskQueueService.ts` - Completely rewritten to remove all local fallback logic and `useLocalFallback` mechanisms
- `src/services/taskQueueService.ts` - Removed localStorage fallback logic for development mode
- `src/services/environmentService.ts` - Completely rewritten to only support AWS environments (staging/production)
- `src/services/adaptiveCharacterService.ts` - Simplified to only use AWS CharacterService, removed all mock service logic

### Application Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed DevServiceManager initialization and AppHeaderDebug import
- `src/components/common/EnhancedErrorBoundary.tsx` - Removed DevServiceManager import
- `src/components/common/NetworkStatusIndicator.tsx` - Removed DevServiceManager references and mock service status

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ServerTaskQueueService Cleanup
- Removed `useLocalFallback` flag and all related conditional logic
- Removed `offlineStateCache` and `pendingOperations` for local fallback
- Removed all local fallback methods (`localAddTask`, `localReorderTasks`, etc.)
- Removed `queuePendingOperation` and `processPendingOperations` methods
- Simplified all methods to only communicate with AWS services
- Removed error handling that would switch to local fallback mode

### 2. TaskQueueService Cleanup
- Removed localStorage usage in `loadPlayerQueue` method
- Removed localStorage usage in `savePlayerQueue` method
- All persistence now goes directly to AWS DynamoDB

### 3. EnvironmentService Cleanup
- Removed local development environment detection
- Removed localhost URL configurations
- Removed `useLocalStorage` and `enableMockAuth` flags
- Simplified to only support 'staging', 'production', and 'test' environments
- Added AWS-specific configuration methods

### 4. AdaptiveCharacterService Cleanup
- Removed all mock service fallback logic
- Removed DevServiceManager dependency
- Simplified to only use AWS CharacterService
- Removed service health checking and automatic fallback mechanisms

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Local + AWS)
```
Frontend -> AdaptiveService -> [MockService | RealService] -> [localStorage | AWS]
```

### After (AWS Only)
```
Frontend -> Service -> AWS Resources (DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway)
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are now required for AWS-only operation:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` or `REACT_APP_AWS_API_URL` - AWS API Gateway endpoint
- `REACT_APP_WS_URL` or `REACT_APP_AWS_WS_URL` - AWS WebSocket endpoint
- `REACT_APP_AWS_REGION` - AWS region (defaults to us-east-1)
- `REACT_APP_AWS_ENVIRONMENT` - 'staging' or 'production'

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified Architecture** - No more dual-path logic for local vs AWS
2. **Reduced Bundle Size** - Removed unused mock services and development utilities
3. **Clearer Error Handling** - All errors now relate to AWS service issues
4. **Consistent Behavior** - No differences between development and production behavior
5. **Easier Debugging** - All issues are AWS-related, no local fallback confusion
6. **Faster Development** - No need to maintain parallel local and AWS implementations

## Next Steps

1. Update all remaining components to remove any local development references
2. Update tests to only test AWS service integrations
3. Update documentation to reflect AWS-only deployment
4. Validate all functionality works correctly with AWS services
5. Deploy to staging environment for validation

## Validation Required

- [ ] All imports of deleted services have been updated
- [ ] All references to `useLocalFallback` have been removed
- [ ] All localStorage usage has been removed
- [ ] All mock service references have been removed
- [ ] Environment detection only supports AWS environments
- [ ] All error handling assumes AWS services
- [ ] Build process completes without errors
- [ ] Application deploys successfully to AWS
- [ ] All functionality works with AWS services only
