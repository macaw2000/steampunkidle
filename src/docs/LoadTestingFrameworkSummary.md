- Cost estimation for different scaling strategies
- Scaling strategy recommendations (vertical, horizontal, hybrid)
- Risk assessment for different growth patterns
- Alternative architecture suggestions

**Growth Scenarios**:
- **Conservative Growth**: 5% monthly growth, steady pattern
- **Aggressive Growth**: 15% monthly growth with marketing campaigns
- **Viral Growth**: 30% monthly growth, exponential adoption
- **Seasonal Business**: Variable growth with seasonal patterns

### 5. LoadTestRunner (`src/testing/loadTesting/LoadTestRunner.ts`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates comprehensive testing workflows combining all components.

**Key Features**:
- Integrated test suite execution (load + stress + benchmarking + capacity planning)
- Optimization validation workflows
- Comprehensive reporting and analysis
- Standard test suite templates
- CI/CD integration capabilities
- Automated recommendation generation

const loadTestRunner = new LoadTestRunner(taskQueueService);
const suite = loadTestRunner.createStandardLoadTestSuite();
const report = await loadTestRunner.executeComprehensiveTestSuite(suite);
console.log(`Performance Score: ${report.performanceScore}/100`);
```

### Optimization Validation
```typescript
const validation = await loadTestRunner.validateOptimization(
  'Database Optimization',
  beforeSuite,
  afterSuite
);
console.log(`Recommendation: ${validation.recommendation}`);
```

### Capacity Planning
```typescript
const capacityPlanner = new CapacityPlanner();
const projection = capacityPlanner.createScalingProjection(1000, 100);
console.log(`Required Instances: ${projection.requiredInstances}`);
console.log(`Estimated Cost: $${projection.estimatedCost}/month`);
```

## Performance Thresholds and Scoring

### Performance Score Interpretation
- **90-100**: Excellent performance, production-ready
- **80-89**: Good performance, minor optimizations recommended
- **70-79**: Acceptable performance, optimization needed
- **60-69**: Poor performance, significant improvements required
- **Below 60**: Unacceptable performance, major rework needed

### Key Thresholds
- **Response Time**: < 1000ms average, < 2000ms P95
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for normal load, < 2% for stress
- **Memory Usage**: < 1000MB peak for baseline scenarios
- **CPU Usage**: < 70% average, < 90% peak
- **Concurrent Users**: > 500 breaking point target
