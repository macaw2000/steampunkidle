### 4. Admin Dashboard (`TaskQueueAdminDashboard.tsx`)

**Dashboard Tabs:**
- **Overview**: Key metrics cards and active alerts summary

**Features:**
- Real-time data refresh (configurable interval)
- Interactive alert management
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Status indicators with color coding
- Historical data visualization
- Export capabilities for metrics and alerts

**Key Components:**
- Metric cards with status indicators (good/warning/critical)
- Alert management table with severity badges
- Resource usage progress bars
- Queue length distribution charts
- Player engagement statistics

### 5. Monitoring Integration (`taskQueueMonitoringIntegration.ts`)

**Features:**
- Service method wrapping for automatic monitoring
- Performance timing for all operations
- Error tracking and categorization
- Security event monitoring
- Database and cache operation tracking

**Key Methods:**
- `wrapServiceMethod()` - Wraps service methods with monitoring
- `monitorTaskProcessing()` - Monitors task lifecycle events
- `monitorQueueState()` - Tracks queue state changes
- `monitorValidation()` - Monitors validation operations
- `monitorSync()` - Tracks synchronization events
- `createPerformanceTimer()` - Creates timing utilities

### 6. Lambda Handler (`taskQueueMonitoringHandler.ts`)

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /monitoring` - Main monitoring operations endpoint
- `GET /monitoring/health` - Health check endpoint

**Supported Actions:**
- `getMetrics` - Retrieve current metrics
- `getAlerts` - Get active alerts and history
- `acknowledgeAlert` - Acknowledge specific alerts
- `resolveAlert` - Resolve specific alerts
- `getTimeSeries` - Get historical metric data
- `submitLogs` - Submit log entries

**Features:**
- Request/response logging and metrics
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- CORS support for web dashboard
- Performance monitoring of handler itself

### 7. Infrastructure (`monitoring-infrastructure.ts`)

**AWS Resources:**
- Lambda functions for monitoring operations and health checks
- SNS topic for alert notifications
- CloudWatch dashboard with custom metrics
- CloudWatch alarms for critical thresholds
- EventBridge rules for periodic health checks

**Monitoring Setup:**
- Custom CloudWatch metrics namespace
- Automated alerting for system health issues
- Dashboard widgets for key performance indicators
- Log metric filters for health check status
- Email and Slack notification integration
