# Task Queue Processing and Reward System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of task 6.3 "Build task queue processing and reward system" from the Steampunk Idle Game specification. The implementation provides continuous task processing every second for all active players, enhanced reward generation, character stat updates, and comprehensive notifications.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced Server-Side Game Engine (src/server/gameEngine.js)

#### Continuous Processing Every Second
- **Game Engine Class**: Implements continuous task processing with 1-second intervals
- **Active Queue Management**: In-memory cache of active task queues for high-performance processing
- **Graceful Startup/Shutdown**: Proper initialization and cleanup with database synchronization
- **Health Monitoring**: RESTful API endpoints for health checks and status monitoring

#### Key Features:
```javascript
// Continuous processing every 1 second
this.processingInterval = setInterval(() => {
  this.processAllQueues();
}, 1000);
```

### 2. Enhanced Reward Generation System

#### Predictable Primary Materials (Requirement 17.1)
- **Guaranteed Primary Material**: Every harvesting action yields exactly one primary material
- **Skill-Based Bonuses**: Tool bonuses, skill levels, and location modifiers affect yield
- **Level Scaling**: Rewards scale with player level (5% bonus per level)

#### Exotic Item Discovery (Requirement 17.2)
- **Base Discovery Rate**: <1% base chance (0.8%) for exotic items
- **Skill Progression Impact**: Higher harvesting skills slightly increase discovery rates
- **Activity-Specific Pools**: Different harvesting categories have unique exotic item pools
- **Rate Capping**: Maximum 2% discovery rate to maintain balance

#### Multi-Activity Support
- **Harvesting Rewards**: Primary materials + experience + exotic item chance
- **Combat Rewards**: Experience + currency + loot drops based on win probability
- **Crafting Rewards**: Experience + crafted items based on success rate

### 3. Character Stat Updates and Experience Distribution

#### Enhanced Character Progression
- **Experience and Level Calculation**: Automatic level progression using sqrt formula
- **Skill Progression**: Activity-specific skill increases (harvesting, combat, crafting)
- **Inventory Management**: Automatic inventory updates for resources and items
- **Currency Distribution**: Proper currency tracking and distribution

#### Database Updates
```javascript
// Comprehensive character updates
updateExpression.push('experience = :exp');
updateExpression.push('inventory.${itemId} = if_not_exists(inventory.${itemId}, :zero) + :${itemId}_qty');
updateExpression.push('stats.harvestingSkills.${skill} = if_not_exists(stats.harvestingSkills.${skill}, :zero) + :skill_gain');
```

### 4. Task Completion Notifications and Progress Tracking

#### Real-Time Progress Updates
- **Progress Notifications**: Sent every 5 seconds during task execution
- **Completion Notifications**: Comprehensive task completion data with rewards
- **Task Started Notifications**: Notifications when new tasks begin
- **Queue Statistics**: Efficiency scores, completion rates, and performance metrics

#### Notification Types
- `task_progress`: Real-time progress updates with time remaining
- `task_completed`: Full completion data with rewards and statistics
- `task_started`: New task initiation notifications
- `queue_updated`: Queue state changes

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Suite

#### Server-Side Tests (src/server/__tests__/gameEngine.test.js)
- **Reward Generation Tests**: Validates predictable primary materials and exotic discovery rates
- **Efficiency Calculation Tests**: Tests queue efficiency scoring algorithms
- **Reward Summarization Tests**: Validates reward summary generation
- **Task Processing Accuracy**: Tests timing and completion logic

#### Integration Tests (src/lambda/activity/__tests__/taskQueueProcessing.integration.test.ts)
- **Continuous Processing Tests**: Validates scheduled processing of all active queues
- **Reward Distribution Tests**: Tests accurate reward application to characters
- **Notification Tests**: Validates comprehensive notification system
- **Error Handling Tests**: Tests graceful error recovery and queue isolation
