**Features:**
- Integrated security validation pipeline
- Admin operation validation with elevated security
- Security status monitoring and reporting
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Context-aware security validation

**Key Methods:**
- `validateOperation()` - Complete security validation for operations

### 7. Secure Service Layer (`SecureServerTaskQueueService`)

**Features:**
- Security-first API design
- Integrated authentication and authorization
- Secure context passing (IP, User-Agent, Session ID)
- Admin-specific security controls
- Comprehensive error handling

**Key Methods:**
- `addHarvestingTask()` - Securely add harvesting tasks
- `addCraftingTask()` - Securely add crafting tasks
